The downloadable TLW is going to be a "dev" download. For example, on TLW release 4 was split up into 2 parts because I didnt do it all at once. Well now, a "halfway" mostlikely unstable updates will be released until the final release is put online, as full builds wont be able to download.

Uhh yeah you can download it again
But these are going to be more of developer builds for the online version
Operation: Code ReWrite is active; I am going to try to rewrite the code for the whole website because after 2 years the code is MESSY! So im gonna try to fix it.
